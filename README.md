# idle-game
Fantasy RPG idle game in HTML/JS. Stable.

# Fighting System
Levels are in increasing difficulty. If you win, it multiplies your gold/xp per second. If you lose, your XP and Gold goes back to zero


# TODO
- round numbers with k, m, etc. 
- can get accessories with random modifiers from fights -- sort of like balatro jokers
- css the buttons to be nicer
